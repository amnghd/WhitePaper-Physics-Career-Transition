# WhitePaper-Physics-Career-Transition

Any Physics graduate student who wants to move from the academia to the industry should prepare for three inter-related situations 
for a successful career transition. I use an allegory to name these situations. These are: finding oneself standing in front of the bridge, then walking on the bridge, and finally sitting on the other side of the bridge. In this white paper I provide a list of tips gleaned from my experience that, I personally think, are appropriate for each situation. A unique combination of these observations 
and their appropriate utilizations helped me cross the bridge and got me land in Finance industry as a Data Scientist.
